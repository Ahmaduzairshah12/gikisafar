## 🚀 Option 4: Use Placeholder Icons (Deploy Now, Fix Later)

For now, just use these emoji-based placeholders:

Create simple colored squares with emoji:
- Background: Emerald (#10b981)
- Emoji: 🚌
- Text: "GIKI"

You can always update the icons later after deploying!

---

## ✅ What You Need:

Place these files in `/public/` folder:
- `icon-192.png` (192 x 192 pixels)
- `icon-512.png` (512 x 512 pixels)

That's it! Your PWA will work with any square PNG images.

## 💡 Pro Tip:

Don't let icons block your deployment! Use simple placeholders now and update them later. The functionality is more important than perfect icons at launch.
